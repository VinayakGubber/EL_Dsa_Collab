# EL_Dsa_Collab

A collaborative repository focused on solving 7 fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms problems. This project serves as a platform for practicing collaborative GitHub workflows including branching, merging, code reviews, and pull requests.

## Project Structure

- Main file: `The_7_Problems.c`
- Each collaborator works on their assigned problems in separate branches
- Branch naming convention: `[name]/[question-number]` (e.g., `username/2`)

## Collaboration Workflow

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a new branch for your assigned problem
3. Implement your solution
4. Push your branch to GitHub
5. Create a pull request
6. Participate in code review
7. Merge changes after approval

## Problems

The repository contains 7 DSA problems:

Problem 1: Find pairs in a doubly linked list with a given sum
Uses two-pointer technique to find all pairs in a doubly linked list whose sum equals the target value.

Problem 2: Inorder traversal of a binary tree
Performs an inorder (Left, Root, Right) traversal of a binary tree using recursion.

Problem 3: Maximum and minimum of an array using minimum number of comparisons
Determines the maximum and minimum elements in an array with minimum comparisons by processing elements in pairs.

Problem 4: Sort a stack using recursion
Recursively sorts a stack in descending order without using any extra stack or array.

Problem 5: Find pivot element in a sorted and rotated array
Finds the pivot (maximum) element in a sorted and rotated array using binary search.

Problem 6: Count nodes in BST whose value lies in a given range
Counts the number of nodes in a Binary Search Tree whose values lie within a specified range using optimized traversal.

Problem 7: Find the second most repeated string in a sequence
Finds the second most frequently occurring string in a sequence using sorting and frequency counting.
